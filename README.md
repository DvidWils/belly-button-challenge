# Module 14: Interactive Visualizations - Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This dashboard visualizes the microbial species found in the belly buttons of test subjects. Users can explore individual subject data, view top 10 microbial species per sample, and observe patterns in bacterial diversity.
This project simulates real-world experience in dashboard creation and client interaction.
